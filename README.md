This is a personal trial with APS problem. An application demo in [APS-app](https://github.com/RPIFisherman/APS-app)

Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP), Linear Programming (LP) and Heuristic methods are used to solve the problem.

NP-hard problem, so the heuristic method is used to solve the problem with a large number of jobs(e.g. >100 orders/jobs).
